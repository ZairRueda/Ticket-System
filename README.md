# Socket Stack Server

Its a application like a stack in a bank or a hospital
We have a ticket which represents a where to person



## Reload no requiring 

In its application when we set a new ticket the server is reloaded (because is the server is linked with database)
But if we don't have reloaded, we need make a new file by configuring the nodemon script
